    title: "What is the process of buying a house in a country?",
    description:
      "Buying a house typically starts with budgeting and obtaining mortgage pre-approval to establish financial limits. Next, potential buyers search for properties in preferred locations using real estate agents or online platforms. Upon finding a suitable property, they conduct inspections, possibly with professional help, to assess the condition. An offer is then made and negotiated. Once accepted, legal checks ensure the property is free of encumbrances. The parties sign a binding contract, finalize financial arrangements, and proceed to closing, where legal documents are signed to transfer ownership. Finally, the property is registered in the buyerâ€™s name, and any applicable taxes are paid.",

      "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",

      "What are the common closing costs associated with purchasing a property?",
    description:
      "When purchasing a property, buyers typically encounter several closing costs. These include appraisal fees to determine the property's value, loan origination fees charged by lenders for processing the mortgage, and inspection fees for evaluating the property's condition. Legal fees cover the services of attorneys or notaries during the transaction. Title insurance protects against potential title defects, while recording fees are paid to local government agencies for officially documenting the change of ownership. Property taxes may need to be settled upfront, and escrow accounts might be established for future real estate taxes and insurance. These costs vary by location and the specifics of the transaction.",
